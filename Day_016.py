# This is Day 16 of 100 Days of Code.
# "Today we are learning about "Object Oriented Programming.""

# In Procedure Programming which we've been doing so far,
# all of the components are connected together from disparate areas.

# OOP is like assigning a group of people to run a restaurant.
# In PRocedural programming, you are supposed to be the "ONE" person who
# does all of the things, but in OOP, you are just the manager looking at your staff
# without telling them what to do, because they are already trained for it.


# How to use OOP????
