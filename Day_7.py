# Hello and good morning - This is Day 7 challenge of one hundred days of python and it deals with concepts we covered through the week
# like; for and while loops, if/elif/else, strings, lists, range and modules

# " So, the first step in making a working hangman is to
#
import random
word_list = ["ardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

# 1. Randomly choose a word from the given list
# to a variable called something like chosen words."

# "2. Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer
# to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase."

# "3. Check if the letter the user guessed is one of the
# letters in the chosen_word"

for word in word_list(0, )
