# This file contains projects and new concepts from Day 8 of 100 Days of Python
# Day 8 is about function with capability of input, arguments and parameters
# The final project is about making a ceasar cipher program which deals
# encrypt and decrypt messages

# def my_function():
#     # Do this
#     # Do that
#     # Then do this and this
#     # Done

def greet():
    print("Hello,")
    print("Welcome to your program.")
    print("I hope you enjoy your stay.")


greet()

# So, to make functions with input capability, we need to add arguments into parantheses.
# Like this:

# def my_function(blah blah blah blah):
#     # Do this
#     # Do that
#     # Then do this and this
#     # Done
