# "This is Day 9 of 100 days of code, we will learn about dictionaries and nesting in programming."

# "so, dictionaries in python are just like dictionaries in real life with some key differences."

# Key -- Value
# Bug -- An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.

# " In python, the dictionary would look like this:"

key = "bug"
value = "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected"

mydic = {key: value}
print(mydic)
