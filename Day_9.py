# "This is Day 9 of 100 days of code, we will learn about dictionaries and nesting in programming."

# "so, dictionaries in python are just like dictionaries in real life with some key differences."

# Key -- Value
# Bug -- An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.

# " In python, the dictionary would look like this:"

key = "bug"
value = "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected"

mydic = {key: value}
print(mydic)

# This is the starting point:

programming_dictionary = {
    "Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.",
    "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
    "Loop": "The action of doing something over and over again.",

}

print(programming_dictionary["Bug"])
