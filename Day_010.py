# This is day 10, and it's about "Functions with Outputs"

# This was the simplest form of a function that we learnt how to make.

# def my_function():
#     Do this
#     Then do this
#     Then do that
#     Finally, do this

# This type of function actually took something is the input:

# def my_function(something):
#     Do this
#     then do this to something
#     then do that
#     dinally, do this

# This type actually has an output:

# def my_function():
#     result = 3 * 2
#     return result

# The code above can be written again like this:

# def my_function():
#     return = 3 * 2


# Here's the exercises for functions with outputs:

def format_name(first_name, last_name):
    first_case = first_name.title()
    last_case = last_name.title()
