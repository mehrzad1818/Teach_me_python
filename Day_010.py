# This is day 10, and it's about "Functions with Outputs"

# This was the simplest form of a function that we learnt how to make.

# def my_function():
#     Do this
#     Then do this
#     Then do that
#     Finally, do this

# This type of function actually took something is the input:

# def my_function(something):
#     Do this
#     then do this to something
#     then do that
#     dinally, do this
